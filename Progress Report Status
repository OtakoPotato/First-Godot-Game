Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!
#### What have you done for your project so far?
Imported all the needed background and sprites, started off some coding for the character movement, and some of the farming functions. (possibly change the map layout more) 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?
Still have to finish more coding for the other farming functions, have a day/night cycle, animal movements and lore. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?
Just simple mistakes of mispelling or just not knowing what function to put yet so more research is needed.
